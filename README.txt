DISPLAYING THE GRID

Ive used by previous part of the submitted work and expanded on it. I used the 2D arrays and turned them into an button array and displayed them on to the grid. After the user selects the grid size this would create a grid size accordingly. The hardness level selected by the user will call the randomPuzzle method. 
	If it is easy this would set 4 solids, Os and Xs.
	If it is Medium this would set 3 solids, Os and Xs.
	If it is Hard this would set 2 solids, Os and Xs.
	If it is Extreme this would set 1 solids, Os and Xs.
All the tiles that are generated by the randompuzzle would be uneditable and this will be colored so the user can easily identify the uneditable squares. 
		
EDITING THE GRID 

When the user clicks on the grid using lambdas im setting the text of the button array. By clicking once the X is displayed, then twice an O and on the third click the square is cleared. After each click, methods such as isLegal would check for illegalities and theillegalities method would put this to a label and display it to the user.  Also would check if the puzzle is complete or not after each click. If the puzzle is complete this would display using an alert box. 

******OPTIONAL EXTRAS******
1) I've added a MenuTab. 
2) Help Option With How to play the Game. 
3) An Author window which gives details about the author. 
4) A dark mode which makes changes the color of the window.
5) An option to start a new game without having to exit the game.
6) An exit option.
7) The uneditable tiles are colored to make it easier for the user to spot them out.
8) A label which displays the illegality with the the error coordinates.
9) I have added another label which displays the remaining spaces this wouldn't decrease if an illegality is found. Would update after every user click.
